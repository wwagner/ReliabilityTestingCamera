DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS - Reliability Testing Camera
=====================================================================

PACKAGE CONTENTS
----------------
This deployment package includes:
- reliability_testing_camera.exe (main application)
- START_CAMERA.bat (recommended launcher)
- plugins/silky_common_plugin.dll (HAL plugin for event camera)
- All necessary DLL dependencies (Release builds only)
- event_config.ini (camera configuration file)
- Documentation files

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
1. Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
2. Visual C++ Redistributable 2022 (x64)
   Download: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
3. Event camera hardware (Prophesee/CenturyArks compatible)

INSTALLATION
------------
1. Extract the entire ZIP file to a folder on your computer
2. Install Visual C++ Redistributable 2022 (x64) if not already installed
3. Verify the folder structure:
   YourFolder/
   ├── reliability_testing_camera.exe
   ├── START_CAMERA.bat
   ├── plugins/
   │   └── silky_common_plugin.dll
   ├── *.dll (all dependency DLLs)
   └── event_config.ini

HOW TO RUN
----------
OPTION 1 (RECOMMENDED): Use the Launcher
   - Double-click START_CAMERA.bat
   - This sets the correct plugin path before starting the application
   - Most reliable method for self-contained deployment

OPTION 2: Direct Execution
   - If you have Metavision SDK installed on your system
   - Double-click reliability_testing_camera.exe
   - The application will use system plugins from C:\Program Files\CenturyArks\plugins

OPTION 3: Manual Plugin Installation (Alternative)
   - Create folder: C:\Program Files\CenturyArks\plugins
   - Copy silky_common_plugin.dll to that folder
   - Run reliability_testing_camera.exe directly

CONFIGURATION
-------------
Edit event_config.ini to customize:
- Camera bias settings (sensitivity, thresholds)
- Frame accumulation time (affects frame rate)
- Binary bit extraction (for reliability testing)
- Anti-flicker, ERC, ROI settings
- Capture directory for saved images

See the comments in event_config.ini for detailed explanations.

FIRST RUN
---------
When you start the application:

1. Console window will show initialization messages
2. Look for: "Setting HAL plugin path to: [folder]\plugins"
3. Camera detection: "Found X camera(s)"
4. If no camera: "Running in simulation mode"
5. Main window opens with camera feed (or black screen if no camera)

Expected messages:
   === Reliability Testing Camera ===
   Setting HAL plugin path to: [your folder]\plugins
   Configuration loaded from event_config.ini
   Initializing single camera...
   Found 1 camera(s)
   Camera started successfully

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Problem: "procedure entry point could not be located in dynamic link library"
Solution:
   - Use START_CAMERA.bat instead of running .exe directly
   - OR install Visual C++ Redistributable 2022 (x64)
   - Make sure all DLLs are in the same folder as the .exe

Problem: "[HAL][WARNING] no plugin found"
Solution:
   - Use START_CAMERA.bat launcher
   - OR copy plugins/silky_common_plugin.dll to C:\Program Files\CenturyArks\plugins\

Problem: "No cameras detected"
Solution:
   - Check camera is plugged in via USB
   - Check Device Manager for "CenturyArks" or event camera device
   - Try a different USB port (preferably USB 3.0)
   - Application will run in simulation mode without camera

Problem: Camera detected but not starting
Solution:
   - Check USB connection quality
   - If you see USB3 warning, try a USB 3.0 port (not required, just recommended)
   - Make sure no other application is using the camera

Problem: DLL errors on startup
Solution:
   - Verify Visual C++ Redistributable 2022 (x64) is installed
   - Don't mix files from different builds - extract all files from ZIP
   - Right-click DLLs → Properties → Unblock if coming from another computer

USING THE APPLICATION
---------------------

Main Features:
1. Live Camera Feed - Real-time event camera visualization
2. Binary Stream Mode - Extract specific bits for reliability testing
3. Image Capture - Save current frame with metadata
4. Image Loading - Load and compare saved images
5. Comparison Tools - Overlay, difference, side-by-side views
6. Scattering Analysis - Detect and analyze pixel scattering
7. Noise Analysis - Statistical noise evaluation

Keyboard Shortcuts:
- See in-app Help menu for full list

Camera Controls:
- Adjust bias settings in Settings panel
- Configure features (ERC, anti-flicker, ROI) in Features panel
- Monitor camera status in real-time

TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------

Plugin Path Resolution:
The application looks for plugins in this order:
1. MZ_HAL_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable (set by START_CAMERA.bat)
2. System installation: C:\Program Files\CenturyArks\plugins
3. Local plugins/ subfolder (low priority, not always checked first)

This is why START_CAMERA.bat is recommended - it sets MZ_HAL_PLUGIN_PATH
before the application starts, ensuring local plugins are used.

Build Configuration:
- Architecture: x64 (64-bit)
- Build type: Release (optimized, no debug symbols)
- All DLLs are Release builds (no *_d.dll files)

Dependencies:
- Metavision HAL and SDK libraries
- OpenCV 4.x
- Boost 1.78
- OGRE 3D rendering engine
- GLFW and GLEW for OpenGL
- ImGui for user interface

DEPLOYMENT NOTES
----------------

Self-Contained Deployment:
This package is designed to be self-contained and portable:
- No installation required
- All dependencies included
- No registry modifications
- Can run from any folder
- Can run from USB drive

Network Deployment:
Safe to deploy via network share:
- Copy entire folder to target machines
